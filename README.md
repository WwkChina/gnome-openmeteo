# Open-Meteo GNOME

Open-Meteo GNOME is an **unofficial, community-maintained** GNOME Shell extension for displaying current weather conditions and short-term forecasts for a user-selected location.

The extension is highly configurable and operates independently of GNOME Weather. Weather data is retrieved from the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API, including multi-day forecasts with 1-hour intervals.

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Open-Meteo.

- Independent of GNOME Weather
- Configurable display and behavior

## Project Status

This project is forked from a mature upstream project and has been significantly refactored.
The weather provider and external API dependency have been removed, and a substantial amount of code has been simplified or modified.

The project is currently in a stable state.  
Unless major issues arise, no active updates are expected.

The maintainer develops and tests the project against the GNOME version shipped with the latest Ubuntu LTS release, currently GNOME 46.
Compatibility with other GNOME versions is not guaranteed and depends on community testing and contributions.
